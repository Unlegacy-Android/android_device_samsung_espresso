/*
 * Problems:
 * 1. Nexus 10's GPS library was made to work with android L
 * 2. Android M changed a few things around that make it not work
 *   a. Sensor manager API changed in a few places
 *   b. BoringSSL replaced OpenSSL
 * 3. Due to these now-missing unresolved symbols GPS library will not load or run
 *
 * A tricky but clever solution: INTERPOSITION library
 * 1. We'll edit the GPS library and replace one of its "NEED" record with one referencing a new library
 *    which we'll create.
 * 2. Make sure that libgpsd-compat's NEED records include the library whose record we replaced in the GPS
 *    library, to make sure that the linker brings it in afterall and all symbols in it are found
 * 3. Implement libgpsd-compat such that it provides the missing things and does them in such a way that the
 *    GPS library is happy.
 *
 * Result: GPS library works on M, with the help of libgpsd-compat and a small binary patch to the GPS
 *         library itself (replacing one of the "NEED" records with a NEED record for "libgpsd-compat")
